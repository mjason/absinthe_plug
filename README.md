"Build Status")](https://travis-ci.org/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_plug)

[Plug](https://hex.pm/packages/plug) support for [Absinthe](https://hex.pm/packages/absinthe),
an experimental GraphQL API toolkit.

Please see the website at [http://absinthe-graphql.org](http://absinthe-graphql.org).

## Installation

Install from [Hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/absinthe_plug):

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:absinthe_plug, "~> 1.2.3"}]
end
```

Add it to your `applications` configuration in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:absinthe_plug]]
end
```

`Absinthe.Plug` also requires a JSON codec. Poison works out of the box.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:absinthe_plug, "~> 1.2.3"},
    {:poison, "~> 1.3.0"}
  ]
end
```
